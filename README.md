## [LZ's Tail & Ears](https://github.com/Lunazera/VNyan-Graphs/tree/main/Tail-Ears)
Adds dynamic tail and ear movement, responsive to head movement and ARKit tracking!

### Tail Features
- Tail will wag back and forth with controls for speed and amount of movement
- Tail wags faster as you smile, and responds to heartrate
- Head tracking based movement
  - Tail moves opposite to how you look, so it will get out of the way of your direction
  - Tail moves down when you raise your head and when you lean forward (so it wont go into your head)
  - Tail moves along your head tilting
 
### Ear Features
- Ears raise up when you raise your eyebrows, and down when you lower them
- Movement is smoothed (no sharp movements!)
- Ears tilt to the side when you tilt your head
- Wiggle when you blink, AND each ear will randomly wiggle over time
